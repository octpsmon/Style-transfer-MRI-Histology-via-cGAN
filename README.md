Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a sensitive tool for probing tissue microstructure and is currently the only non-invasive method available for examining the brain's fiber architecture. As MRI technology becomes more advanced, its comparison with microscopic imaging of the same tissue samples is increasingly valuable, potentially eliminating the need for invasive biopsy procedures for patients in the future.

This study presents a method for generating microscopic images from MRI scans of the corpus callosum of the brain using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture [Isola et al., 2017]. The proposed technique involves training paired image translation models using sets of images from MRI scans of the corpus callosum and corresponding microscopic images. This approach leverages the strengths of both MRI and microscopy, providing a comprehensive and non-invasive means of examining brain tissue at a microscopic level.
